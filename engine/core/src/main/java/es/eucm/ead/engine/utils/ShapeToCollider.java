	/**
	 * Builds a circumscribed polygon for a {@code circle} that can be used as a
	 * collider.
	 * 
	 * The number of sides of the polygon is specified through param
	 * {@code nSides}.
	 * 
	 * The algorithm to calculate the minimum nSides polygon that covers a
	 * circle (circumscribed) is as follows:
	 * 
	 * (To see what a circumscribed polygon is, visit: <a href=
	 * "http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/plane/circumscribed_polygons.html"
	 * >http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/plane/circumscribed_polygons.html</a>)
	 * 
	 * 1) Distance from circle's center to each vertex (equidistant) is
	 * calculated (d).
	 * 
	 * 2) A vector with length d is calculated.
	 * 
	 * 3) Vector is added to the circle's center to get one vertex.
	 * 
	 * 4) The vector is rotated "a" degrees. "a" is calculated by dividing 360ยบ
	 * by the number of sides of the polygon.
	 * 
	 * (3) and (4) are repeated until all the vertices are calculated.
	 * 
	 * Note: d=r/cos(a/2), where: r: circle's radius a: angle
	 * 
	 * See <a href="https://github.com/e-ucm/ead/wiki/Shape-renderer">This wiki
	 * page</a> for more details
